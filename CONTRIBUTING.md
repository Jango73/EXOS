# Contributing

Contributing is **not open** yet for the following reasons :

- EXOS is still young : there are still massive changes from time to time (renaming, refactoring, adapting, ...), either because I missed architectural key elements, or to fix "vibe coding" of AI, which happens quite a lot.
- EXOS is unknown : I don't feel like spending a lot of time managing merges for an unused software.
