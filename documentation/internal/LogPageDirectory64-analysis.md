# LogPageDirectory64 Analysis

The `LogPageDirectory64` dump shows that the very first PTE (`PTE[0]`) of the low virtual address range maps virtual address `0x0000000000000000` to physical address `0x0000000000014000`. The second PTE listed (`PTE[0]` for `PDE[1]`) maps virtual address `0x0000000000200000` to the same physical address `0x0000000000014000`.

Because the physical frame referenced by these entries is `0x0000000000014000` instead of matching the virtual addresses (`0x0` and `0x200000` respectively), the mapping is not an identity mapping. Consequently, the first 4 MiB of RAM are **not** identity-mapped in this dump.
