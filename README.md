# EXOS

## What it is

This was an attempt, around 1997, to create an operating system.
It is work in progress.

Because it is a very old work, it will probably never be finished.

## Things it does

* Task management with scheduler
* Virtual memory management
* File system management : FAT, FAT32, XFS (EXOS file system)
* SATA Hard disk driver
* Console management
* Primitive graphics using VESA standard
* Heap management
* Basic keyboard and mouse management

## Things to do

* Create makefiles for build (used to build on DOS using gcc and nasm)
