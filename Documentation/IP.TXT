Version (4 bits)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: version

Length: 4 bits

Contents: current IP version.

IP version 4 (IPv4) uses IP addresses with 4 bytes in length.

IP version 6 (IPv6) uses IP addresses with 16 bytes in length.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IP Header Length (IHL) (4 bits)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: IP header length (IHL)

Length: 4 bits

Contents: length of current IP header.

Since the IP header's length may vary, it must be indicated. The IP header's length depends on the use of IP options.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type of Service (TOS) (1 byte)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: type of service (TOS)

Length: 1 byte

Contents: indicates the type of IP service.

The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired.
These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a
datagram through a particular network. Several networks offer service precedence, which somehow treats high
precedence traffic as more important than other traffic (generally by accepting only traffic above a certain
precedence at time of high load). The major choice is a three way tradeoff between low-delay, high-reliability,
and high-throughput. 

Bits 0-2: Precedence.

Bit 3: 0 = Normal Delay, 1 = Low Delay.

Bits 4: 0 = Normal Throughput, 1 = High Throughput.

Bits 5: 0 = Normal Relibility, 1 = High Relibility.

Bit 6-7: Reserved for Future Use.

The use of the Delay, Throughput, and Reliability indications may increase the cost (in some sense) of the service.
In many networks better performance for one of these parameters is coupled with worse performance on another.
Except for very unusual cases at most two of these three indications should be set.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Length (2 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: total length

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: lenth of IP datagram including data.

Total Length is the length of the datagram, measured in octets, including internet header and data. This
field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets. Such long datagrams are impractical for
most hosts and networks. All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets (whether
they arrive whole or in fragments). It is recommended that hosts only send datagrams larger than 576
octets if they have assurance that the destination is prepared to accept the larger datagrams. 

The number 576 is selected to allow a reasonable sized data block to be transmitted in addition to the
required header information. For example, this size allows a data block of 512 octets plus 64 header
octets to fit in a datagram. The maximal internet header is 60 octets, and a typical internet header is 20
octets, allowing a margin for headers of higher level protocols. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identification (2 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: identification

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: unique datagram identifier.

An identifying value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the fragments of a datagram. Since IP
is able to send datagrams with up to 65,535 octetts, these large frames must be fragmented if
transmitted on traditional LANs. The "Identification" field is used to aid reassembly. 

For each fragment, the "Identifier" field value is increased by one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flags (3 bits)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: flags

Length: 3 bits

Contents: fragmentation commands.

Because IP datagrams may be fragmented (see 'Identification' field), fragmentation commands are
needed.

1. bit (reserved)

reserved / unused

2. bit (DF)

0=May Fragment

1=Don't Fragment

3. bit (MF)

0=Last Fragment

1=More Fragments

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fragment Offset (13 bits)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: fragment offset

Length: 13 bits

Contents: fragment's position in original datagram.

This field indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs. The fragment offset is measured in
units of 8 octets (64 bits). The first fragment has offset zero.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time to Live (TTL) (2 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: time to live (TTL)

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: remaining lifetime of IP datagram.

This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the internet system. If this
field contains the value zero, then the datagram must be destroyed. This field is modified in internet
header processing. The time is measured in units of seconds, but since every module that processes a
datagram must decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in less than a second,
the TTL must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may exist. The intention is
to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded, and to bound the maximum datagram lifetime. 

Any router's configured "metric" value takes causes the TTL value to be decreased accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protocol (1 byte)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: protocol

Length: 1 byte

Contents: upper layer protocol ID.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Header Checksum (2 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: header checksum

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: checksum covering IP header.

A checksum on the header only. Since some header fields change (e.g., time to live), this is recomputed
and verified at each point that the internet header is processed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Address (4 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: source address

Length: 4 bytes

Contents: IP address of sending host.

See: IP addresses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destination Address (4 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: destination address

Length: 4 bytes

Contents: IP address of target host.

See: IP addresses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options (n bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: options

Length: n bytes

Contents: additional IP options (if any).

The options may appear or not in datagrams. They must be implemented by all IP modules (host and
gateways). What is optional is their transmission in any particular datagram, not their implementation. 

In some environments the security option may be required in all datagrams.

The option field is variable in length. There may be zero or more options. There are two cases for the
format of an option:

Case 1:

A single octet of option-type.

Case 2:

An option-type octet, an option-length octet, and the actual option-data octets.

The option-length octet counts the option-type octet and the option-length octet as well as the
option-data octets.

The option-type octet is viewed as having 3 fields:

1 bit copied flag,

2 bits option class,

5 bits option number.

The copied flag indicates that this option is copied into all fragments on fragmentation.

0 = not copied

1 = copied

The option classes are:

0 = control

1 = reserved for future use

2 = debugging and measurement

3 = reserved for future use

The following internet options are defined:

CLASS NUMBER LENGTH DESCRIPTION

----- ------ ------ -----------

0 0 - <End of Option list> This option occupies only

1 octet; it has no length octet.

0 1 - <No Operation> This option occupies only 1

octet; it has no length octet.

0 2 11 <Security> Used to carry Security,

Compartmentation, User Group (TCC), and

Handling Restriction Codes compatible with DOD

requirements.

0 3 var. <Loose Source Routing> Used to route the

internet datagram based on information

supplied by the source.

0 9 var. <Strict Source Routing> Used to route the

internet datagram based on information

supplied by the source.

0 7 var. <Record Route> Used to trace the route an

internet datagram takes.

0 8 4 <Stream ID> Used to carry the stream

identifier.

2 4 var. <Internet Timestamp>

Padding (0-3 bytes)

Protocol: IP IP PCI

Field: padding

Length: 0-3 bytes

Contents: IP datagram alignment to 32 bit border.

If IP options are used, the IP datagram possibly would not end on the required 32 bit border. Alignment
to 32 bit border is done by padding bytes.
