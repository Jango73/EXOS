3 - Routing Information Protocol (TCP/IP)

Move the mouse pointer to any protocol field and press the left mouse button.



RIP is a protocol for exchanging routing information among gateways and other hosts. It is intended to
be used as a basis for developing gateway software for use in the Internet community.

RIP is based on the Bellman-Ford (or distance vector) algorithm. This algorithm has been used for
routing computations in computer networks since the early days of the ARPANET. The particular
packet formats and protocol are based on the program "routed", which is included with the Berkeley
distribution of Unix. An early derivate was developed by Xerox as part of XNS. Internet RIP and XNS
RIP are similar, but not the same. 

Routing is the method by which the host or gateway decides where to send the datagram. It may be
able to send the datagram directly to the destination, if that destination is on one of the networks that
are directly connected to the host or gateway. However, the interesting case is when the destination is
not directly reachable. In this case, the host or gateway attempts to send the datagram to a gateway
that is nearer the destination. The goal of a routing protocol is very simple: It is to supply the information
that is needed to do routing. 

Limitations of the protocol

This protocol does not solve every possible routing problem. As mentioned above, it is primary intended
for use as an IGP, in reasonably homogeneous networks of moderate size. In addition, the following
specific limitations should be mentioned: 

1.

The protocol is limited to networks whose longest path involves 15 hops. The designers believe that the
basic protocol design is inappropriate for larger networks. Normally a cost of 1 is used for each
network. This is the way RIP is normally configured. If the system administrator chooses to use larger
costs, the upper bound of 15 can easily become a problem. 

2.

The protocol depends upon "counting to infinity" to resolve certain unusual situations. (This will be
explained in the next section.) If the system of networks has several hundred networks, and a routing
loop was formed involving all of them, the resolution of the loop would require either much time (if the
frequency of routing updates were limited) or bandwidth (if updates were sent whenever changes were
detected). Such a loop would consume a large amount of network bandwidth before the loop was
corrected. We believe that in realistic cases, this will not be a problem except on slow lines. Even then,
the problem will be fairly unusual, since various precautions are taken that should prevent these
problems in most cases. 

3.

This protocol uses fixed "metrics" to compare alternative routes. It is not appropriate for situations
where routes need to be chosen based on real-time parameters such a measured delay, reliability, or
load. The obvious extensions to allow metrics of this type are likely to introduce instabilities of a sort
that the protocol is not designed to handle. 

Maximum datagram size

The maximum datagram size is 512 octets. This includes only the portions of the datagram. It does not
count the IP or UDP headers. The commands that involve network information allow information to be
split across several datagrams. No special provisions are needed for continuations, since correct results
will occur if the datagrams are processed individually.

RIP

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command (1 bte)

Protocol: IP RIP PCI (TCP/IP)

Field: command

Length: 1 byte

Contents: request / reply.

The following commands are specified:

1 - request

A request for the responding system to send all or part of its routing table.

2 - response

A message containing all or part of the sender's routing table. This message may be sent in response to
a request or poll, or it may be an update message generated by the sender.

3 - traceon

Obsolete. Messages containing this command are to be ignored.

4 - traceoff

Obsolete. Messages containing this command are to be ignored.

5 - reserved

This value is used by Sun Microsystems for its own purposes. If new commands are added in any
succeeding version, they should begin with 6. Messages containing this command may safely be ignored
by implementations that do not choose to respond to it.

Version (1 byte)

Protocol: RIP RIP PCI (TCP/IP)

Field: version

Length: 1 byte

Contents: current RIP version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Address Family ID (2 bytes)

Protocol: RIP RIP PCI (TCP/IP)

Field: address family identifier

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: network-layer protocol identifier (IP=2).

RIPv1 only uses one AFI=2 for the internet protocol (IP). RIPv2 uses AFI=0xFFFF if the
authentication function is used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Address (4 bytes)

Protocol: RIP RIP PCI (TCP/IP)

Field: address

Length: 4 bytes

Contents: destination router address.

IP address of the destination router that will receive the RIP datagram.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metric (4 bytes)

Protocol: RIP RIP PCI (TCP/IP)

Field: netric

Length: 4 bytes

Contents: hop count.

The metric field must contain a value between 1 and 15 inclusive, specifying the current metric for the
destination, or the value 16, which indicates that the destination is not reachable.
