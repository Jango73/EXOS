2 - Point-to-Point Protocol

PPP provides WAN links on point-to-point lines. PPP is the successor of SLIP which could only serve
the Internet Protocol (IP); PPP is able so serve any kind of network protocol (IPX, AppleTalk, DECnet
and others). 

Main components:

1.

A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links. PPP uses HDLC (ISO 3309-1979) as a basis
for encapsulating datagrams over point-to-point links. At this time, PPP specifies the use of
asynchronous or synchronous duplex circuits, either dedicated or circuit switched. 

2.

An extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, configure, and test the data-link connection.

3.

A family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer
protocols. PPP is designed to allow the simultaneous use of multiple network-layer protocols.

In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link, the originating PPP would first send
LCP packets to configure and test the data link. After the link has been establish and optional facilities
have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, the originating PPP would send NCP packets to choose
and configure one or more network-layer protocols. Once each of the chosen network-layer protocols
has been configured, datagrams from each network-layer protocol can be sent over the link. 

The link will remain configured for communications until explicit LCP or NCP packets close the link
down, or until some external event occurs (e.g., inactivity timer expires or user intervention).

Physical Layer Requirements:

The Point-to-Point Protocol is capable of operating across any DTE/DCE interface (e.g., EIA
RS-232-C, EIA RS-422, EIA RS-423 and CCITT V.35). The only absolute requirement imposed by
PPP is the provision of a duplex circuit, either dedicated or circuit switched, which can operate in either
an asynchronous (start/stop) or synchronous bit-serial mode, transparent to PPP Data Link Layer
frames. PPP does not impose any restrictions regarding transmission rate, other than those imposed by
the particular DTE/DCE interface in use. 

PPP does not require the use of modem control signals, such as Request To Send (RTS), Clear To
Send (CTS), Data Carrier Detect (DCD), and Data Terminal ready (DTR). However, using such
signals when available can allow greater functionality and performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flag (1 byte)

Protocol: PPP PPP PCI

Field: flag

Length: 1 byte

Contents: frame delimiter.

The Flag Sequence is a single octet and indicates the beginning or end of a frame. The Flag Sequence
consists of the binary sequence 01111110 (hexadecimal 0x7e).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Address (1 byte)

Protocol: PPP PPP PCI

Field: address

Length: 1 byte

Contents: destination address (predefined).

The Address field is a single octet and contains the binary sequence 11111111 (hexadecimal 0xff), the
All-Stations address. PPP does not assign individual station addresses. The All-Stations address should
always be recognized and received. The use of other address lengths and values may be defined at a
later time, or by prior agreement. Frames with unrecognized Addresses should be reported through the
normal network management facility. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control (1 byte)

Protocol: PPP PPP PCI

Field: address

Length: 1 byte

Contents: type of PPP operation (predefined: HDLC-UI).

The Control field is a single octet and contains the binary sequence 00000011 (hexadecimal 0x03), the
Unnumbered Information (UI) command with the P/F bit set to zero. Frames with other Control field
values should be silently discarded. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protocol (2 bytes)

Protocol: PPP PPP PCI

Field: protocol

Length: 2 bytes

Contents: uppler layer protocol ID.

The Protocol field is two octets and its value identifies the protocol encapsulated in the Information field
of the frame. The most up-to-date values of the Protocol field are specified in the most recent
"Assigned Numbers" RFC. Initial values are also listed below. 

Protocol field values in the "cxxx" range identify datagrams as belonging to the Link Control Protocol
(LCP) or associated protocols. Values in the "8xxx" range identify datagrams belonging to the family
of Network Control Protocols (NCP). Values in the "0xxx" range identify the network protocol of
specific datagrams. 

0x0xxx: Network Layer Protocols

0x4xxx: (user defined)

0x8xxx: Network Control Protocols (NCPs)

0xCxxx: Link Control Protocols (LCPs)

This Protocol field is defined by PPP and is not a field defined by HDLC. However, the Protocol field
is consistent with the ISO 3309 extension mechanism for Address fields. All Protocols MUST be odd;
the least significant bit of the least significant octet MUST equal "1". Also, all Protocols MUST be
assigned such that the least significant bit of the most significant octet equals "0". 

New Protocol values are assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority / IANA@isi.edu).

Frames received which don't comply with these rules should be considered as having an unrecognized
Protocol, and should be handled as specified by the LCP. 

The Protocol field is transmitted and received most significant octet first.

Link establishment is done by LCP which is a function of PPP. The protocol value C021 indicates that
the Information field contains LCP data.

Setup of network-layer protocols is done by NCPs (Network Control Protocols), for example by IPCP
(Internet Protocol Control Protocol) for etablishment of IP links.

INFORMATION (n bytes)

Protocol: PPP PPP PCI

Field: information

Length: n bytes

Contents: LCP / NCP protocol data / user data

The Information field is zero or more octets. The Information field contains the datagram for the
protocol specified in the Protocol field. The end of the Information field is found by locating the closing
Flag Sequence and allowing two octets for the Frame Check Sequence field. The default maximum
length of the Information field is 1500 octets. By prior agreement, consenting PPP implementations may
use other values for the maximum Information field length. 

On transmission, the Information field may be padded with an arbitrary number of octets up to the
maximum length. It is the responsibility of each protocol to disambiguate padding octets from real
information.
